# Tortoise Linux Base

This is the base profile for building the Tortoise ISO. 
All more complex ISO builds must be based on this repository.

## building the ISO

To build the ISO, make sure the following dependencies are installed

* base devel
* archiso

Now, run

make

After that, if the build process completes successfully, you will have a fresh ISO in the iso/ folder
